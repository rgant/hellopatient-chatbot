# Python 3.13

Experiencing installation issues when using python 3.13. Reverting to 3.12 does
not have the issue.

## `Pydantic` install problem

Note: This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a problem with poetry but one of the following issues with pydantic-core (2.14.6)

  - not supporting PEP 517 builds
  - not specifying PEP 517 build requirements correctly
  - the build requirements are incompatible with your operating system or Python version
  - the build requirements are missing system dependencies (eg: compilers, libraries, headers).

You can verify this by running pip wheel --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 "pydantic-core (==2.14.6)".
